This is the first of many repositories that I'll start.

# Quality standards
In line with Hacktoberfest value #2 (Quantity is fun, quality is key), here are examples of the PRs that we consider to be low-quality contributions (which we discourage).

* PRs that are automated (e.g. scripted opening PRs to remove whitespace/optimize images)

* PRs that are disruptive (e.g. taking someone else's branch/commits and making a PR)

* PRs that are regarded by a project maintainer as a hindrance vs. helping

* Something that's clearly an attempt to simply +1 your PR count for October

* Last but not least, one PR to fix a typo is fine. 5 PRs to remove a stray whitespace... not.
