This is the first of many repositories that I'll start.

# Quality standards
In line with Hacktoberfest value #2 (Quantity is fun, quality is key), here are examples of the PRs that we consider to be low-quality contributions (which we discourage).

* PRs that are automated (e.g. scripted opening PRs to remove whitespace/optimize images)

* PRs that are disruptive (e.g. taking someone else's branch/commits and making a PR)

* PRs that are regarded by a project maintainer as a hindrance vs. helping

* Something that's clearly an attempt to simply +1 your PR count for October

* Last but not least, one PR to fix a typo is fine. 5 PRs to remove a stray whitespace... not.

# Participation rules

To qualify for the official limited edition Hacktoberfest shirt, you must register and then make four pull requests (PRs) between October 1-31 (in any time zone). PRs can be made to any public repo on GitHub, not only the ones with issues labeled Hacktoberfest. If a maintainer reports your pull request as spam or behavior not in line with the projectâ€™s code of conduct, you will be ineligible to participate. This year, the first 50,000 participants who successfully complete the challenge will earn a T-shirt. (Last year 46,088 earned a shirt!)
